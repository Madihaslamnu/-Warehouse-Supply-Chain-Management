This project simulates a warehouse system using the Producer-Consumer problem model in C. 
It supports multithreading with pthreads, mutexes, and semaphores to manage synchronized access to shared buffers. 
Orders are handled through normal and priority queues for real-time processing. 
Features include order tracking, live status updates, logging, and a console-based interface. Built for Linux (Ubuntu).
